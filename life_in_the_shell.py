"""
Conway's Game of Life is a simulation that involves the creation and evolution of simple
cellular automata that obey a set of basic rules.
See more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life.
Suppose that the game world is made up of a grid, and that this grid is inhabited by cells.
A cell can be either alive or dead during each "generation", a generation is no more than a turn
in the game of life.
To determine if a spot in a grid is occupied by an alive cell Conway created three rules:
    1. A cell stays alive if it has two or three neighbors.
    2. A cell will be born if there will be exactly three neighbors.
    3. Any cell that doesn't fall in the first two cases will die or stay dead.
    
This particular and basic implementation was heavily inspired by Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff,
that as always provides great inspiration and starting points for personal projects, more at
